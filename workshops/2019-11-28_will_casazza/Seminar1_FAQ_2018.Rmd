Common  mistakes for Seminar 1 (2018)

* mistaking the prompt to be part of the command: i.e., don't include "$" as part of your command.
* changing folders in the middle of setting up SSH key: make sure you remain in the same folder.
* not having permission to write/read because you are not logged in as an administrator to your computer
* misspelling the command, or leaving out a character. 
* NOTE: if you google the specific error you get, most of the time you can find the answer!
* misunderstanding what "~" means


Suggested updates to seminar 1:

* Don’t include “$” as part of command, as command line prompts are usually shared without it
* Use code brackets to document all code
